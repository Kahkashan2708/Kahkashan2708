## About Me  
I am a Data Scientist and ML/AI Enthusiast with a strong foundation in Mathematics, currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Mathematics at IIT Madras**.  
I have gained hands-on experience through internships and projects at **AI4Bharat, IIT Madras Research Park (ERNET India), and IIT Guwahati**, where I worked on predictive modeling, NLP pipelines, and deep learning architectures.  

My expertise includes **Python, SQL, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, MLflow, DVC, and Docker**.  
I enjoy exploring **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and MLOps** to build impactful AI solutions.  

Outside of academics and projects, I like to mentor students in Mathematics and contribute to collaborative learning environments.
